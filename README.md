### I'm a student from Asia Pacific College in Makati here in The Philippines

I'm an aspiring web developer, but I've mostly been studying the front-end stack for now, and I hope to eventually reach out to being a full-stack developer. Aside from programming, I also enjoy reading and writing stories (preferrably scary ones) when I have the time, particularly on Reddit. ðŸ˜„
